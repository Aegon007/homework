'''
Canonical Genetic Algorithm (CGA)
Representation:     Fixed-length bit string
Population:         Fixed-size
Initialization:     Random drawn from linear probability distributions
Parent Selection:   Roulette Wheel Selection (Fitneww Proportional)
Crossover:          Single-Point Crossover. CGA generally uses large crossover rates
Mutation:           Bitwise (each bit has a probability of flipping its state). CGA generally uses small mutation rates
Survivor Selection: Everyone passes this. ALL SELECTION is done in the parent selection phase in CGA
Termination:        Various, but most often convergence of the bitstrings. When ALL genomes in the population become
                    identical, or when some defined large number of them do, then you consider the population "converged"
                    and stop the process. For our purposes, use genome convergence combined with a fixed stopping point.
                    Really, for harder problems you may not actually see "hard convergence".

Output specific:
    When your code runs, it should print out a "one time" header that contains this info:
        <problem name> <population size> <bitstring genome length> <mutation rate> <crossover rate>

    After that initial line, for every generation that is completed, you should print an additional line that contains
    this info:
        <generation number> <fitness score of the most fit member of the population> <average fitness score>
        <precent of genomes in population that are identical>

    When your algorithm terminates, you should print a final line that gives the reason for termination, which should be
    either the population has converged OR you went over some finite "safty limit" that bounded how many generations you
    were willing to run.

Optimization of Rosenbrock:
    In brief, what Iâ€™m asking you to do is to modify your CGA to find values of x and y such that the following function is MINIMIZED:
        f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b(y - x^2), where a = 1 and b = 100
